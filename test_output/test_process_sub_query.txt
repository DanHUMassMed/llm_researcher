(AP) \u2014 An unusual late-summer storm turned a week-long counterculture fest into a sloppy mess with tens of thousands of partygoers stuck in foot-deep mud and with no working toilets in the northern Nevada desert. But some Burning Man revelers said Sunday that their spirits remained unbroken.Organizers closed the festival to vehicles after one death was reported. Officials provided no details of the fatality.The annual gathering in the Black Rock Desert about 110 miles (177 kilometers) north of Reno attracts nearly 80,000 artists, musicians and activists for a mix of wilderness camping and avant-garde performances. Disruptions are part of the event\u2019s recent history: Organizers had to temporarily close entrances to the festival in 2018 due to dust storms, and the event was twice canceled altogether during the pandemic.\n\nSource: https://www.foxweather.com/weather-news/burning-man-festival-mud-rain-desert\nTitle: \nContent: mass exodus out of Burning Man Footage shows thousands of Burning Man attendees driving out of the Nevada festival grounds on Sept. 4 after being stranded by floodwater and mud over the weekend.\u00a0Festival organizers said traffic from Black Rock City to Interstate 80 was at about a 5-hour delay early Tuesday, but had improved to 3 hours later in the morning.\u00a0\"There is an estimated 2-3 hour wait to leave Black Rock City,\" Burning Man Traffic posted on X. \"Everyone should get plenty of rest before starting to travel on the highway.
